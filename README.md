# Frontend Plan

- First a welcome page mostly the same design as in the youtube video.
- then a login page which has two different sections like patient login system and then the staff management login portals where first they sign up and login into the web application.
- Again in the staff mgmt portal, we'll be having doctors login part and the nurse / attendees login portal where doctors and nurse can sign up and sign in.
- In **Patient Dashboard**, we'll show different tabs like appointments he have as well as the previous appointments, then the medicines which he was prescibed in the first appointment or his current medication history.
- In **Doctor Dashboard**, we'll show his day-to-day appointments to attend, his particular patients data.
- In **Nurse Dashboard**, we'll show the day-to-day appointments they need to attend as well the doctors information as well to consult for any information.
- If possible, we need a ** Admin Dashboard** as well, to control all these details being controlled around the different pages.
